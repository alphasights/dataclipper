Dataclipper
===========

A simple elixir script to migrate dataclips from one source to another
(quickly and concurrently). Edit `lib/dataclipper.ex` and then run
`Dataclipper.run`. You'll need to get some tokens which you can get by
inspecting an HTTP request (in browser) to Dataclips. You can just
update one manually via the Web interface.
